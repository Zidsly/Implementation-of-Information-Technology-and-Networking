# Implementation of Information Technology and Networking in Printing Business

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of **Information Technology (IT)** and **Networking** in a printing business. It covers essential aspects such as a business description, network topology and design, hardware and software requirements, and cost analysis. 

The implementation aims to enhance the operational efficiency of the printing business through robust IT systems and optimized network design. This includes ensuring seamless communication, effective data management, and uninterrupted 24-hour business operations.

## System Summary
The role of **Information Technology** in the business world is indispensable, especially in the printing business. IT supports not only **E-Commerce** but also various business functions such as **customer relationship management**, **data management**, and **management information systems**. The six important roles of IT in business are:
1. Simplify How to Communicate
2. Providing Knowledge and Information Resources
3. Data Management
4. Management Information System
5. Customer Relationship Management
6. Business Activities For 24 Hours

This project includes:
- A detailed network topology design using **LAN** with a hybrid topology.
- Implementation of **E-Commerce** for customer convenience.
- Optimization of IT infrastructure for reliable and cost-effective operations.

## Network Topology Design
The network design uses a **LAN (Local Area Network)** with a **hybrid topology** to accommodate the numerous devices and hardware present in the printing business. The topology combines:
1. **Star Topology**: Used in the server room to connect each room on the 1st and 2nd floors.  
   - Ensures high performance and simple troubleshooting.
   - Routers are installed in multiple rooms to provide wireless connections and access points.
2. **Tree Topology**: Applied to connect devices across different floors and areas.
3. **Bus Topology**: Specifically for the machine room, chosen for:
   - Minimal cable requirements.
   - Cost efficiency.
   - Simple expansion and coverage management.

### Key Components of the Network
- **Server Room**: Centralized star topology for efficient communication.
- **Machine Room**: Cost-effective bus topology for connecting devices.
- **Service Room, Waiting Room, Offices**: Wireless access points for flexibility and ease of use.

## Tools & Technology Stack
- **Microsoft Visio**: For network design and visualization.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. **Microsoft Visio**: Install for viewing and editing the network topology diagrams.
2. **LAN Hardware**: Ensure availability of switches, routers, cables, and access points.
